Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Adrian. I am a security researcher interested in applying program
analysis techniques to reverse engineering and software security problems.
I have a penchant for programming languages theory and formal methods. I have a
(rarely updated) blog that is mainly about these things.

In addition to my day job as a researcher at
[Interrupt Labs](https://www.interruptlabs.co.uk/) I teach [software
  security](https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/course/comp3703) at the
[Australian National University](https://www.anu.edu.au) (ANU). ANU is also
where I completed my PhD, under the supervision of [Tony
  Hosking](http://hosking.github.io/) (ANU),
[Mathias Payer](https://nebelwelt.net/) (EPFL), and
[Michael Norrish](https://comp.anu.edu.au/people/michael-norrish/) (ANU).

In a previous life I undertook software security research at the [Defence
  Science and Technology Group](https://www.dst.defence.gov.au/) and
hacked on the [S2E](http://s2e.systems) symbolic execution engine at the
[Dependable Systems Lab](https://dslab.epfl.ch/). I regularly contribute
to [open-source software](https://github.com/adrianherrera) (mostly focused
around program analysis and software security. Unsurprisingly) and speak at both
"hacker" and academic conferences in Australia. My CV is available
[here](/assets/cv.pdf).

When I'm not writing/breaking software I like to cook, run, climb, and take
photos of things (generally not at the same time).
