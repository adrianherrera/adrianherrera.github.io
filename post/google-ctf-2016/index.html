    <h1 class="title"> Solving a CTF Challenge with S2E </h1>
    <div class="content"> 

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Symbolic execution tools such as <a href="http://angr.io">Angr</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/trailofbits/manticore">Manticore</a> have become increasingly
popular for analyzing binaries in Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges.</p>

<p>In this blog post I will show that we can do the same with S2E, using it to
solve a reverse engineering challenge from the 2016 Google CTF. This post
walks through the process of writing an S2E plugin &ldquo;from first principles&rdquo; to
solve this challenge.</p>

<p>For comparison, solutions for the challenge using
<a href="https://github.com/angr/angr-doc/blob/master/examples/google2016_unbreakable_0">Angr</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/trailofbits/manticore-examples/tree/master/google2016_unbreakable">Manticore</a>
are also available. If you want to cheat and skip straight to the end, the
final plugin code is available <a href="https://gist.github.com/adrianherrera/397dc68918374c81cf63e53e659bd083">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>

<p>As usual, I use <a href="https://github.com/S2E/s2e-env">s2e-env</a> to organize my S2E
environment. The challenge binary is a 64-bit ELF, so I will use S2E&rsquo;s Debian
x86_64 image. For those playing along at home, the instructions on how to
use s2e-env can be found
<a href="https://github.com/S2E/docs/blob/master/src/s2e-env.rst">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="initial-analysis">Initial analysis</h2>

<p>The challenge binary is available
<a href="https://github.com/ctfs/write-ups-2016/tree/master/google-ctf-2016/reverse/unbreakable-enterprise-product-activation-150">here</a>.
As other
<a href="http://www.99cruster.com/blog/2016/05/02/google-ctf-2016-unbreakable-enterprise-product-activation-writeup-using-angr/">writeups</a>
have discussed, an initial static analysis reveals that the binary (a 64-bit
ELF executable) accepts a single command line argument (the product activation
code). If this argument is not provided the program will print a usage message
and exit.</p>


<figure>
    <a href="/img/google-ctf-2016-binja.png">
        <img src="/img/google-ctf-2016-binja.png" alt="Disassembly view" />
    </a>
    
</figure>


<p>If the product activation code is provided, the argument is copied into the
global buffer <code>dest</code>. The <code>strncpy</code> operation (at address <code>0x4005B8</code>) copies 67
characters, so we can assume that the product activation code is 67 characters
long. We are also told that the product activation code starts with &ldquo;CTF{&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Further analysis reveals that the function at <code>0x400850</code> is called when an
incorrect product activation code is given. The correct product activation call
will result in the function at <code>0x400830</code> being called and the message &ldquo;Thank
you — product activated!&rdquo; printed. Therefore, when exploring the program we
want to focus on states that will lead to <code>0x400830</code> and avoid those that lead
to <code>0x400850</code>. With this information, we can develop an S2E plugin to solve the
challenge.</p>

<h2 id="creating-the-s2e-project">Creating the S2E project</h2>

<p>We can use s2e-env&rsquo;s <code>new_project</code> command to create a new analysis project for
the challenge. We can also use our knowledge about the product activation code
to automatically add the command line argument to the bootstrap script. Create
the project using the following command:</p>

<pre><code class="language-shell">s2e new_project --image debian-8.7.1-x86_64 --sym-args=&quot;1&quot; unbreakable \
    `python -c &quot;print('CTF{%s' % ('x' * (67 - 4)))&quot;`
</code></pre>

<p>The Python code will generate a 67 character string starting with &ldquo;CTF{&rdquo;.
<code>--sym-args=&quot;1&quot;</code> makes the first argument (i.e. the product activation code)
symbolic. Note that the actual contents of the string are not important.</p>

<p>The astute observer might also notice that the printed instructions contain a
message regarding S2E&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/S2E/docs/blob/master/src/Plugins/Linux/FunctionModels.rst">FunctionModels</a>
plugin. I will discuss how we can use this plugin later.</p>

<h2 id="writing-the-s2e-plugin">Writing the S2E plugin</h2>

<p>We will develop a custom plugin to solve the challenge. Note that this is
probably the more complex and time-consuming approach — you could also use
S2E&rsquo;s Lua annotations to avoid having to write C++ code. However, I think that
developing a plugin from scratch is a better way to understand how S2E works.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the standard S2E plugin template. Create
<code>libs2eplugins/src/Plugins/GoogleCTFUnbreakable.h</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-cpp">#ifndef S2E_PLUGINS_GOOGLE_CTF_UNBREAKABLE_H
#define S2E_PLUGINS_GOOGLE_CTF_UNBREAKABLE_H

#include &lt;s2e/CorePlugin.h&gt;
#include &lt;s2e/Plugin.h&gt;

namespace s2e {
namespace plugins {

class GoogleCTFUnbreakable : public Plugin {
    // Declares an S2E plugin
    S2E_PLUGIN

public:
    // Our constructor doesn't need to do anything
    GoogleCTFUnbreakable(S2E *s2e) : Plugin(s2e) { }

    // This will be called by S2E when registering and configuring the different plugins
    void initialize();

private:
    // We will add some more methods later
};

} // namespace plugins
} // namespace s2e

#endif
</code></pre>

<p>And in <code>libs2eplugins/src/Plugins/GoogleCTFUnbreakable.cpp</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-cpp">#include &lt;s2e/S2E.h&gt;

#include &quot;GoogleCTFUnbreakable.h&quot;

namespace s2e {
namespace plugins {

S2E_DEFINE_PLUGIN(GoogleCTFUnbreakable, // Plugin class
                  &quot;Solve the Google CTF unbreakable product activation code&quot;, // Plugin description
                  &quot;&quot;, // Unused
                  ); // Plugin dependencies (currently there are none)

void GoogleCTFUnbreakable::initialize() {
}

} // namespace plugins
} // namespace s2e
</code></pre>

<p>This is a perfectly valid S2E plugin, it just doesn&rsquo;t do anything useful. We
need to tell the plugin what events we are interested in and how to react to
them during runtime.
<a href="https://github.com/S2E/libs2ecore/blob/master/include/s2e/CorePlugin.h">CorePlugin.h</a>
gives an idea of what events are available. Events can also be generated by
other plugins. For example, the
<a href="https://github.com/S2E/libs2eplugins/blob/master/src/s2e/Plugins/OSMonitors/OSMonitor.h">OSMonitor</a>
plugin generates events for process creation, module loading/unloading, etc.</p>

<p>So what events are we interested in? From our initial analysis we know the
function addresses that indicate success or failure. We can therefore use the
<code>onTranslateInstructionStart</code> event to notify us when the code at these
addresses is translated by QEMU. Declare an event handler in
<code>GoogleCTFUnbreakable.h</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-cpp">private:
    // The method signature corresponds to the onTranslateInstructionStart
    // signal template in CorePlugin.h
    void onTranslateInstruction(ExecutionSignal *signal,
            S2EExecutionState *state, TranslationBlock *tb, uint64_t pc);
</code></pre>

<p>We also need to register our interest in this event, which we do in the
plugin&rsquo;s <code>initialize</code> method.</p>

<pre><code class="language-cpp">void GoogleCTFUnbreakable::initialize() {
    s2e()-&gt;getCorePlugin()-&gt;onTranslateInstructionStart.connect(
        sigc::mem_fun(*this, &amp;GoogleCTFUnbreakable::onTranslateInstruction));
}
</code></pre>

<p>This event occurs when code is translated by QEMU. We need to register another
event listener to notify our plugin when the code is actually executed. We do
this using the <code>ExecutionSignal</code> that is generated by the
<code>onTranslateInstructionStart</code> event. In <code>GoogleCTFUnbreakable.cpp</code> (don&rsquo;t
forget to add the method declarations to <code>GoogleCTFUnbreakable.h</code>):</p>

<pre><code class="language-cpp">// We found these addresses during our initial analysis in IDA Pro.
// Note that we assume non-PIE addresses
static const uint64_t SUCCESS_ADDRESS = 0x400724;
static const uint64_t FAILURE_ADDRESS = 0x400850;

void GoogleCTFUnbreakable::onTranslateInstruction(ExecutionSignal *signal,
        S2EExecutionState *state, TranslationBlock *tb, uint64_t pc) {
    if (pc == SUCCESS_ADDRESS) {
        // Register a handler for when the &quot;success&quot; code is executed
        signal-&gt;connect(sigc::mem_fun(*this, &amp;GoogleCTFUnbreakable::onSuccess));
    } else if (pc == FAILURE_ADDRESS) {
        // Register a handler for when the &quot;failure&quot; code is executed
        signal-&gt;connect(sigc::mem_fun(*this, &amp;GoogleCTFUnbreakable::onFailure));
    }
}

void GoogleCTFUnbreakable::onSuccess(S2EExecutionState *state, uint64_t pc) {
    // We will return to this later
}

void GoogleCTFUnbreakable::onFailure(S2EExecutionState *state, uint64_t pc) {
    // There is no reason to continue execution any further. So kill the state
    s2e()-&gt;getExecutor()-&gt;terminateStateEarly(*state, &quot;Invalid path&quot;);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Once execution reaches either the success or failure code, there is no reason
to continue. We therefore kill the state to avoid wasting resources.</p>

<p>Note that we use absolute addresses for our success and failure code. For
position independent code (PIE), you will need to register for module load
events, record the load address of the module you are interested in (in this
case unbreakable) and calculate the success and failure addresses via offsets
at run time.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there is a problem with our plugin. Remember that S2E performs
full-system emulation, meaning other processes may be executing at the same
time that we are analyzing unbreakable. Virtual addressing also means that
there may be other processes that have code at <code>SUCCESS_ADDRESS</code> and
<code>FAILURE_ADDRESS</code>. If this code is executed, our plugin&rsquo;s <code>onSuccess</code> and
<code>onFailure</code> methods will execute, potentially interfering with our analysis.
We will avoid this problem with the
<a href="https://github.com/S2E/libs2eplugins/blob/master/src/s2e/Plugins/OSMonitors/Support/ProcessExecutionDetector.h">ProcessExecutionDetector</a>
plugin.</p>

<p>The <code>ProcessExecutionDetector</code> tracks the execution of processes in the
system. It is configurable so that only processes of interest are tracked. To
add this plugin as a dependency, in <code>GoogleCTFUnbreakable.cpp</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-cpp">#include &lt;s2e/Plugins/OSMonitors/Support/ProcessExecutionDetector.h&gt;

S2E_DEFINE_PLUGIN(GoogleCTFUnbreakable,
                  &quot;Solve the Google CTF unbreakable product activation code&quot;,
                  &quot;&quot;,
                  &quot;ProcessExecutionDetector&quot;); // Plugin dependency

void GoogleCTFUnbreakable::initialize() {
    m_procDetector = s2e()-&gt;getPlugin&lt;ProcessExecutionDetector&gt;();

    // ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>And add the <code>ProcessExecutionDetector</code> as a private member of the
<code>GoogleCTFUnbreakable</code> class:</p>

<pre><code class="language-cpp">// In GoogleCTFUnbreakable.h
class GoogleCTFUnbreakable : public Plugin {
// ...

private:
    ProcessExecutionDetector *m_procDetector;

// ...
};
</code></pre>

<p>Now we can filter out all other processes <strong>except</strong> the unbreakable process.
The following code should be added to the <strong>beginning</strong> of the
<code>onTranslateInstruction</code> event handler:</p>

<pre><code class="language-cpp">void GoogleCTFUnbreakable::onTranslateInstruction(ExecutionSignal *signal,
        S2EExecutionState *state, TranslationBlock *tb, uint64_t pc) {
    // The processes to track are declared in the S2E LUA configuration file
    if (!m_procDetector-&gt;isTracked(state)) {
        return;
    }

    // ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>This takes care of our success and failure paths. What about the rest of our
initial analysis? Remember that we were told that the activation code begins
with &ldquo;CTF{&rdquo;. How can we encode this knowledge in our plugin?</p>

<p>Because we made the product activation string symbolic, we can use the
<code>onSymbolicVariableCreation</code> event to wait for the product activation code to
become symbolic, and then constrain this variable with our existing knowledge.
In <code>GoogleCTFUnbreakable.cpp</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-cpp">#include &lt;klee/util/ExprTemplatees.h&gt;

// Register our onSymbolicVariableCreation event handler
void GoogleCTFUnbreakable::initialize() {
    s2e()-&gt;getCorePlugin()-&gt;onSymbolicVariableCreation.connect(
        sigc::mem_fun(*this, &amp;GoogleCTFUnbreakable::onSymbolicVariableCreation));

    // ...
}

void GoogleCTFUnbreakable::onSymbolicVariableCreation(S2EExecutionState *state,
        const std::string &amp;name, const std::vector&lt;klee::ref&lt;klee::Expr&gt;&gt; &amp;expr,
        const klee::MemoryObject *mo, const klee::Array *array) {
    // This check is not strictly required, because we only have one symbolic
    // variable in the analysis.
    //
    // The first program argument made symbolic with the S2E_SYM_ARGS
    // environment variable will have the name &quot;arg1&quot;.
    if (name != &quot;arg1&quot;) {
        return;
    }

    // We know that the product activation key starts with &quot;CTF{&quot;. We encode
    // this information as KLEE constraints
    state-&gt;constraints.addConstraint(E_EQ(expr[0], E_CONST('C', klee::Expr::Int8)));
    state-&gt;constraints.addConstraint(E_EQ(expr[1], E_CONST('T', klee::Expr::Int8)));
    state-&gt;constraints.addConstraint(E_EQ(expr[2], E_CONST('F', klee::Expr::Int8)));
    state-&gt;constraints.addConstraint(E_EQ(expr[3], E_CONST('{', klee::Expr::Int8)));
}
</code></pre>

<p>Encoding this information in the form of additional constraints helps to speed
up symbolic execution. Now the constraint solver will not waste time generating
solutions which we know are not viable (e.g. activation codes beginning with
&ldquo;ABCD&rdquo;, &ldquo;1337&rdquo;, etc.).</p>

<p>We could have also encoded additional constraints for our solution. For
example, we can assume that none of the remaining characters is a NULL
terminator.</p>

<pre><code class="language-cpp">for (unsigned i = 4; i &lt; expr.size(); ++i) {
    state-&gt;constraints.addConstraint(E_NEQ(expr[i], E_CONST('\0', klee::Expr::Int8)));
}
</code></pre>

<p>An alternate set of constraints could be that the other remaining characters
are printable ASCII characters.</p>

<pre><code class="language-cpp">for (unsigned i = 4; i &lt; expr.size(); ++i) {
    state-&gt;constraints.addConstraint(E_GE(expr[i], E_CONST(' ', klee::Expr::Int8)));
    state-&gt;constraints.addConstraint(E_LE(expr[i], E_CONST('~', klee::Expr::Int8)));
}
</code></pre>

<p>In practice I found that these additional constraints had a significant impact
on performance. I will discuss this later.</p>

<p>The final step is to complete the <code>onSuccess</code> method. This involves solving the
constraints accumulated during symbolic execution and displaying the result.</p>

<pre><code class="language-cpp">#include &lt;cctype&gt;
#include &lt;sstream&gt;

void GoogleCTFUnbreakable::onSuccess(S2EExecutionState *state, uint64_t pc) {
    // `results` is a vector containing pairs of strings and a vector of bytes.
    // The string corresponds to the symbolic variable's name while the vector
    // of bytes is the actual solution
    std::vector&lt;std::pair&lt;std::string, std::vector&lt;unsigned char&gt;&gt;&gt; results;

    // Invoke the constraint solver
    if (!s2e()-&gt;getExecutor()-&gt;getSymbolicSolution(*state, results)) {
        getWarningsStream(state) &lt;&lt; &quot;Unable to generate a solution for the product activation code\n&quot;;
        exit(1);
    }

    // Since we only have a single symbolic variable, we will only have a
    // single result. We then iterate over the bytes in this result to print
    // the solution
    std::stringstream ss;
    for (auto c : results[0].second) {
        if (!std::isprint(c)) {
            break;
        }
        ss &lt;&lt; (char) c;
    }

    getInfoStream(state) &lt;&lt; &quot;Product activation code = &quot; &lt;&lt; ss.str() &lt;&lt; &quot;\n&quot;;

    // No need to continue running S2E — terminate
    exit(0);
}
</code></pre>

<p>With the plugin complete, we need to ensure that it is compiled with the other
S2E plugins. To do this, add the following to <code>libs2eplugins/src/CMakeLists.txt</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-cmake">src/Plugins/GoogleCTFUnbreakable.cpp
</code></pre>

<p>S2E will need to be rebuilt to ensure that our plugin is compiled and available
for the analysis. Finally, we need to rebuild S2E with our plugin.</p>

<pre><code class="language-shell">s2e build --clean-target libs2e
</code></pre>

<h2 id="capturing-the-flag">Capturing the flag</h2>

<p>With the plugin complete, we can use it to solve the challenge. First, the
plugin must be enabled in our project&rsquo;s S2E config file. By default,
<code>s2e new_project</code> will generate a <code>s2e-config.lua</code> file with a standard set of
plugins enabled and configured. However, most of them are not needed for this
challenge. At a minimum the following plugins <strong>must</strong> be enabled:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>GoogleCTFUnbreakable</code></li>
<li><code>BaseInstructions</code></li>
<li><code>HostFiles</code></li>
<li><code>LinuxMonitor</code></li>
<li><code>ProcessExecutionDetector</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, we can run S2E with the <code>launch-s2e.sh</code> script. After a short while
S2E will terminate and the following message will be displayed:</p>

<pre><code class="language-shell">Product activation code = CTF{0The1Quick2Brown3Fox4Jumped5Over6The7Lazy8Fox9}
</code></pre>

<h2 id="performance">Performance</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s return to the discussion on (1) the <code>FunctionModels</code> plugin and (2)
the performance impact caused by enforcing additional constraints on the
product activation code.</p>

<h3 id="using-the-functionmodels-plugin">Using the FunctionModels plugin</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/S2E/docs/blob/master/src/Plugins/Linux/FunctionModels.rst">FunctionModels</a>
plugin attempts to reduce <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_execution#Path_Explosion">path explosion</a>.
<code>s2e-env</code> analyzes the binary when the <code>new_project</code> command is executed and
determines that the binary imports the <code>strncpy</code> function, for which a model
exists.</p>

<p><code>strncpy</code> is typically implemented as a loop over the input string until either
a NULL terminator is found or <code>n</code> characters have been copied. By analyzing the
binary in a disassembler we can see that this input string is the product
activation key, which we made symbolic. Looping over a symbolic string will
result in a greater number of states forked, because any of the 63 characters
following the &ldquo;CTF{&rdquo; prefix could contain a NULL terminator.</p>

<p>By enabling the <code>FunctionModels</code> plugin, the <code>strncpy</code> loop will be
replaced by a single symbolic expression, reducing the total number of states
forked. However, this comes with some performance trade-offs that I will
discuss later.</p>

<p>To enable the <code>FunctionModels</code> plugin, add the following to <code>s2e-config.lua</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-lua">add_plugin(&quot;FunctionModels&quot;)
</code></pre>

<h3 id="measuring-performance">Measuring performance</h3>

<p>With the flag under our belt, we can now explore the various performance
trade-offs that must be taken into account when we (1) apply various
constraints to the product activation code and (2) use the <code>FunctionModels</code>
plugin. Results are given in the tables below — one for execution time and one
for the number of states forked.</p>

<p>For the &ldquo;explore all states&rdquo; results I removed the call to <code>exit</code> in the
<code>onSuccess</code> method, even after capturing the flag (in practice this is
unnecessary). For reference I also give the Angr results (as quoted from their
source code) and Manticore results (from running it myself).</p>

<p>The first set of results are our baseline. The only constraints that we impose
are that the product activation code begins with &ldquo;CTF{&rdquo;; the remaining 63
characters are unconstrained. Of the 111 states forked before the solution is
found, 62 of them occurred within <code>strncpy</code>. These 62 states correspond to the
NULL terminator being located within one of the remaining 63 characters
(e.g. &ldquo;CTF{\0&rdquo;, &ldquo;CTF{x\0&rdquo;, &ldquo;CTF{xxxxxxxx\0&rdquo;, etc.). However, the depth-first
search (DFS) strategy means that none of these 62 states is scheduled for
execution before the solution is found. The total number of states quickly
explodes otherwise.</p>

<p>Now look at the performance after we constrain the remaining 63 characters of
the product activation code to <strong>exclude</strong> the NULL terminator. The total
number of states is reduced to 49. While this has negligible impact on
execution time (when we terminate after the solution is found — again due to
DFS), the total number of states no longer explodes.</p>

<p>Performance degrades significantly when we over-constrain the product
activation code to <strong>only</strong> contain printable ASCII characters. While the total
number of states is reduced, the bottleneck is simply transferred from state
exploration to the constraint solver.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: To view the symbolic formulae during execution the
<code>--verbose-fork-info</code> can be added to the <code>kleeArgs</code> table in <code>s2e-config.lua</code>.</p>

<p>Finally, we find that the <code>FunctionModels</code> plugin reduces the state space to
the same levels as when we excluded NULL terminators from the product
activation code. However, like when we over-constrain, the formula that the
constraint solver must solve grows increasingly complex after the <code>strncpy</code>
model is applied and the constraint solver once again becomes the bottleneck.</p>

<p>I personally find this trade-off between state space and constraint formulae
complexity quite interesting. AFAIK there are no automatic ways to determine
this trade-off; it can only be found through experimentation.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Compared to the Angr and Manticore solutions, solving this challenge with S2E
may seem overly complex. There are a variety of reasons for this: S2E runs a
full-system emulator, so the user must handle the full software stack (OS
kernel, libraries, drivers, etc.); S2E is written in C++; and S2E is built on
top of many different tools and frameworks (KLEE, QEMU, LLVM, etc.), each with
their own APIs.</p>

<p>Ultimately it is a matter of selecting the correct tool for the job. For
CTF-style challenges, where the program is largely self-contained and has very
little interaction with the rest of the system (e.g. the OS, libraries such as
libc, etc.), using full-system emulation is probably overkill (however, as I&rsquo;ve
hopefully demonstrated, it can be done!). However for more complex software
(e.g. device drivers, software with more complex interaction with the system,
etc.), S2E may be the more suitable choice.</p>
